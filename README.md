# Hi there 👋

I'm Magomed, a Project Manager and budding Frontend Developer with a knack for Python and data analytics. Currently leading a talented team at Tinkoff Mobile's chatbot, I'm on a mission to switch gears into development.

👨‍💻 **Developing:** I'm honing my frontend skills, building on a foundation laid by Python and SQL for analytics automation.

🎮 **Interests:** Outside of coding, I'm a gamer, sports enthusiast, and a Jiu-Jitsu practitioner.

🚀 **Goals:** Transitioning from product management to full-time development, aiming to craft seamless user experiences.

Feel free to reach out for collaborations or just a chat about tech, sports, or anything in between!
